Hi, I'm Micah Murayama
I'm interested in development
I'm currently learning simple consulting duties 
I'm originally from the island of Oahu
I'm a senior in electrical engineering
I chose this major because I was interested in the problem solving aspect of engineering and I specifically chose electrical because of the direction that the world is going into as everything is becoming more electrical based
A fun fact about me is that I have injured both of my eyes
What do I want to learn from 205? I would like to learn how to become more efficient in object based programming as the only previous experience I have with coding was a simple introductory course
A book or movie I'd recommend is: The Intern
